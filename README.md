## Introduction

**metaval** is a bioinformatics pipeline that verifies the organisms predicted by the nf-core/taxprofiler pipeline using metagenomic data, including both Illumina short-gun sequencing and Nanopore sequencing data.

At moment, metaval only checks the classification results from three classifiers `Kraken2`, `Centrifuge` and `diamond`

## Pipeline summary

1. Extract classified reads for organisms of interest, such as all identified viruses or a predefined list of organisms.

2. Use `BLAST` to identify the closet reference genome for the extracted reads (Downsample if there are more than 200 reads)

3. Map the extracted reads to reference genomes using `Bowtie2` for Illumina reads and `minimap2` for Nanopore reads.

4. Construct consensus maps for the mapped reads.

5. Generat Coverage plots


## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Describe the minimum required steps to execute the pipeline, e.g. how to prepare samplesheets.
     Explain what rows and columns represent. For instance (please edit as appropriate):

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

Each row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end).

-->

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

<!-- TODO nf-core: update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/metaval \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/metaval/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/metaval/parameters).
